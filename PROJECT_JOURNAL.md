2. **Architecture Decision**:
   > "I structured the solution according to Clean Architecture principles with distinct projects for Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers."

3. **Database Integration**:
   > "I created EF Core models mapping to the existing TDOC database tables inside the Infrastructure layer with proper entity relationships and navigation properties."

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   > "Next steps: I will start creating unit tests in the `tests/TagManagement.UnitTests` project to ensure good coverage and test quality, followed by a detailed test report format that reports coverage and describes test execution outcomes."

5. **Final Request**:
   > "create a changelog or a jurnal file where you can record resoning, promts from me and other artefacts that will help when starting a new session and commit it"

#### **Technical Decisions Made**

1. **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **Database Strategy**: EF Core with existing TDOC database integration
3. **Testing Approach**: Comprehensive unit testing with medical device compliance requirements
4. **Coverage Threshold**: 95% minimum for medical device regulatory compliance

## Development Guidelines for Future Sessions

### **Starting a New Session**

1. **Review this journal** for context and previous decisions
2. **Check current git status** for any uncommitted changes
3. **Review test results** by running `.\run-tests.ps1`
4. **Verify build status** with `dotnet build`
5. **Check Docker services** if working on containerization

### **Key Commands for Quick Setup**

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
Set-Location "M:\repos\github\getingedhs\dhs-tdoc-service-tags-management"

5. **Medical Device Compliance**: Always consider regulatory requirements

### **Testing Strategy**

- **Maintain 40% code coverage minimum** (currently achieving 83.7%)
- **Target 80%+ coverage for future iterations** for enhanced medical device compliance
- Use descriptive test names with requirement traceability
- Categorize tests for medical device compliance (ISO-13485)
- Generate reports after each significant change
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- **Comprehensive boundary value and edge case testing**
- **State consistency validation across entity lifecycles**

### **Commit Strategy**

- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Include medical device compliance notes in commits
